### **Key Trading Criterias**

- **Price action relative to MA20 and MA40**
  - Use the MA20 and MA40 to confirm trends [up/downtrend].
  - MA20/MA40 crossovers to determine entry or exit points:
    - MA20 crosses above MA40 (Golden Cross) → BUY signal.
    - MA20 crosses below MA40 (Death Cross) → SELL signal.

- **RSI levels and trend**
  - Use the RSI levels to identify a trend [up/downtrend].
  - RSI > 50 equals to uptrend, else equals downtrend.
  - RSI >= 80 (overbought) → Please consider a SELL action.
  - RSI <= 30 (oversold) → Please consider a BUY action.

- **Volume patterns**
  - **Volume** represents the total number of trades or the amount of an asset traded over a specific time period.
  - **Rising volume paired with rising price** means uptrend.
  - **Rising volume paired with falling price** means downtrend.
  - **Falling volume with rising or falling price**:
    - Signals weakening momentum.
    - The trend may be losing strength, and a reversal or consolidation could follow.
  - **Volume spikes**:
    - A sudden, large increase in volume often indicates heightened market activity due to news, announcements, or hitting key price levels.
    - May signal the start of a new trend, a breakout, or a potential reversal.
  - **Low volume during consolidation**:
    - Indicates a lack of market interest or indecision.
    - Often precedes a breakout or breakdown, as volume eventually increases.
  - **Volume divergence**:
    - Occurs when price and volume move in opposite directions:
      - If price is rising but volume is decreasing → Potential weakness in the uptrend.
      - If price is falling but volume is decreasing → Downtrend may be losing strength.

- **Recent price movements**
  - Analyze how the price has behaved in the short term to identify potential momentum or reversals.
  - Look for patterns such as:
    - **Higher highs and higher lows** → Indicates a strong uptrend.
    - **Lower highs and lower lows** → Suggests a strong downtrend.
  - **Sharp price changes**:
    - Sudden increases or decreases in price may indicate heightened volatility or market reaction to news/events.
  - **Consolidation patterns**:
    - If the price is moving within a narrow range, it may signal indecision before a breakout or breakdown.
  - **Candlestick patterns**:
    - Use candlestick analysis (e.g., doji, engulfing patterns) to predict potential reversals or continuation of trends.

### **Implementing These Strategies in an AI Trading Agent**

To implement these trading strategies in an AI agent, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Integrate with market data APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) to fetch real-time and historical data.
   - Collect necessary indicators such as:
     - Price data (open, high, low, close, volume).
     - Technical indicators like MA20, MA40, RSI, and volume trends.

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Build logic for each strategy:
     - Use moving averages to confirm trends and detect crossovers.
     - Calculate RSI values to determine overbought or oversold conditions.
     - Analyze volume patterns to validate price movements and identify breakouts or reversals.

3. **Decision Engine**
   - Define clear decision rules for the agent:
     - **BUY**: When signals like MA20 crossing above MA40 and RSI > 50 align.
     - **SELL**: When signals like MA20 crossing below MA40 and RSI < 50 align.
     - **HOLD**: When no clear trend or signal is identified.

4. **Risk Management**
   - Implement risk controls:
     - Set stop-loss and take-profit levels based on recent price movements.
     - Use position sizing to limit exposure (e.g., allocate smaller positions to low-confidence signals).

5. **Execution Layer**
   - Use trading APIs to place and manage orders programmatically.
   - Monitor trades and adjust positions in real-time based on updated signals.

6. **Continuous Learning**
   - Integrate machine learning models to improve signal accuracy over time.
   - Use historical data to backtest and validate strategies.

7. **Monitoring and Reporting**
   - Build a dashboard to visualize key metrics like:
     - Current positions.
     - Signal confidence levels.
     - Portfolio performance.
   - Set alerts for critical events (e.g., stop-loss triggers, breakout signals).

# Robust strategy

### **Strategy Looks in Practice**
- Buy Signal:

When RSI ≤ 30:
Execute a spot trade to buy the asset using available funds.
This captures the rebound from oversold conditions.

- Sell Signal:

When RSI ≥ 80:
Sell all or a significant portion of the holding.
This locks in profits before a likely reversal.

   
### Considerable amount of timeframe
- After research for quite some time, the reliable timeframe for executing trades would be 4h and 1d timeframes
