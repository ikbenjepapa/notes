## **Key Concepts in Python**

1. **Variables and Data Types**:
   ```python
   name = "Alice"  # String
   age = 25         # Integer
   is_student = True # Boolean
   ```

2. **Control Flow**:
   ```python
   if age > 18:
       print("Adult")
   else:
       print("Minor")
   ```

3. **Functions**:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       return f"Hello, {name}!"
   print(greet("Alice"))
   ```

4. **Loops**:
   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)
   ```

5. **Classes and Objects**:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age
       
       def introduce(self):
           return f"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old."

   alice = Person("Alice", 25)
   print(alice.introduce())
   ```
